The first steps I took in my project was coming up with an idea. The idea for my CLI is it being a learning app that you can use daily. After I got my idea I started searching for websites that had daily facts, words, news, qoutes, etc. This process took some time but, I found a couple websites that I really liked.

Getting the project started was very exciting for me. Followed videos, chatted with other programmers, read articles and soon enough I had a working skeleton program. My skeleton program was simple: 

1.1.The program opens with a greeting
2.Then presents a list of catagories
3.It takes in input and then returns your selection

The next step in creating my CLI was scraping. I chose scraping over using API's because I wanted to be challenged and I worked with HTML and CSS so I had a good enough understanding to find what I was looking for. After time spent with errors and debugging, I finally got my first website to return all the information I needed. My project at this point was half skeleton and half real working data. I continued the process of scraping the other websites. Once I was done and everything was working I realized that my code was not up to par. 

I again met with programmers, watched videos, and read blogs so I could get nice clean code. I made many changess during this process and added some new features to the program. By the end of it all I was proud of what I made and I believe I learned more in this past two weeks than I thought possible.
