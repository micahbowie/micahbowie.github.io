WWHT - Why, What, and How Terms. WWHT THE? Is a web application to explore why, what, and how explanations of technology terms. 

To build this application I used PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Nodejs, CSS, and JavaScript . The backend was built first, I started by planning out my models, database, and contollers. After setting up the backend, I took time planning the UI/UX  of the website. This process took a great amount of time but, I am glad i planned it out. The website has a simple design but, allows users to easily navigate through all features of the application. 

For the frontend I used React/Redux. This was a learning curve for me but I really feel I have gotten good at working with a React code base.  For styling I used pure CSS instead of using any frameworks or libraries I decided to test my skills at styling in all custom CSS.
