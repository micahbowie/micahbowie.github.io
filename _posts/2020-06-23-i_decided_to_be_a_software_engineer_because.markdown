   When I was still in high school I was given the oppurtunity to learn some web development. Since that time I have always had a curiosity/desire to learn more about coding. Coding gives you the ability to create something, problem solve, be apart of community, and so much more. I think that going through this curriculum will be one of the most challenging things I have done to date but, I'm so ready for it. 

   After finishing my learning I plan to make the career change and start a new chapter or my life. The salary increase will allow me to do things that I have always wanted to do and explore other new adventures in my life. I hope that I don't just get a new job out of this. I wish for connections, new life skills, good habbits, and knowledge. 

   I chose to be a software engineer because I know it has the power to change my life in so many ways. It is a chance to challenge my self and master something. I chose to be a software engineer to create.
