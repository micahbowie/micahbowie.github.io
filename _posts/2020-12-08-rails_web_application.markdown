For my rails web app, I decided to make an app called Devtop. The idea behind Devtop; users whould be able to open up Devtop and have all of their favorite websites, links, apps, notes, etc. You should be able to open up your IDE and then Devtop is the only tab you have open in yout browser. 

Gems used:

- "omniauth"
-"bulma-rails"
- "better_errors"
- "dotenv-rails"
