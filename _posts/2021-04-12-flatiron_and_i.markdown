When I first began looking for boot camps or programs to learn coding I wasn't sure which one was better,  if boot camps were a scam, what commitment it would take, or how it would change my life. 

After weeks of researching every Bootcamp under the sun and even looking into college courses, I decided to choose Flatiron. I just had an inner peace about Flatiron and I knew that it is where I needed to be. My journey originally started with excitement and then two months into the program I considered dropping out. I just got so overwhelmed with work and school. But, because I quickly made friends with 4 other developers I had a support system to keep afloat. After getting over this one moment of doubt and trials I have not looked back since. 

I have fallen in love with coding and knowledge and now because I was able to persevere my life has changed forever. Flatiron has been a great blessing and they have delivered everything they promised and more. I could not have chosen a better Bootcamp to attend.
