 For my Sinatra project I decided to make a notes app called "Jot it down".  My vision for the website was a very simple and sleek web design where users can create, read. update, and delete notes. After finishing my project I am very proud of the way it turned out. I ran into some problems here and there but, I learned more doing this project than the other weeks combined it feels like. 
		 
		 To start off my project I used the handy gem called "corneal". This gem helped make some of my structutures, connections, and routes. After running and installing the gem I customized the file to fit my needs and project. Once I had things how I wanted I started buidling in my application controller. From there I built and mounted the rest of my controllers and models. This was a pretty straight forward process since I planned ahead and already had an idea of what I would need and how to set it up. 
		 
		 I was off to a great start but, my local enviroment was not setup correctly and I was running into issues getting certain gems and dependcies working. After 2 days of trying to troubleshoot I fixed the problem and had a working enviroment. Unfortunately in the process I had to delete my previous work. I was now back at square one. I quickly started on my project again. 
		 
		 The most fun for me was the backend or server side of the project. I love breaking things and then getting them to work. I did also enjoy the frontend of things. I took a lot of time trying to figure out CSS so I could get the style exactly how I wanted it. I am going to give this project another shot next week on our break and try to build something more complex.
