For my JS web app, I decided to make an app called ASMS. The idea behind ASMS is a staff management software. User will be able to create employees and contacts. They would also be able to keep track of school information, equipment and schedules, this app was made as a SPA(Single page application). I used vanilla JavaScript with some, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Ruby on Rails for the backend. I plan to add a lot more to this project. The two CRUD functions I included were Read and create.
